<h1>Hey guys ðŸ‘‹</h1>
<p>I'm 16-years-old graphic designer and front-end engineer amateur from Brazil, I like to build beautiful and functional things. I usually create websites with CSS and HTML but I'm learning other languages like C++, Javascript, Python and PHP. 
I currently have a small design company called <a href="https://instagram.com/byswitzer">Switzer</a> and I'm working on developing my design website.
I'm a programming baby but I want to grow and become a magnificent developer.</p>
<p>A weird curiosity about me is that I always listen to ABBA's songs when I'm creating something</p>
